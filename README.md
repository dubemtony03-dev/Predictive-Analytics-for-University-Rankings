# Predictive-Analytics-for-University-Rankings
Universities aim to understand and improve their performance in global and national rankings. This project explores how institutional KPIs (student satisfaction, staff ratios, spending, etc.) can predict ranking outcomes.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Collect and preprocess Guardian and THE datasets.
- Build regression and Random Forest models.
- Evaluate using Pearson correlation and cross-validation.
- Identify key features influencing rankings.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## ðŸ“Š Results
- Achieved strong correlation between predicted and actual rankings (Pearson r â‰ˆ X.XX).
- Student satisfaction emerged as the most important feature.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure
- `notebooks/` â†’ Jupyter notebooks for data cleaning, modeling, and evaluation.
- `src/` â†’ Reusable Python scripts for preprocessing and modeling.
- `results/` â†’ Key visualizations and outputs.

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Clone this repo
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/university-rank-prediction-model.git
